# TransKT: A Transferable Knowledge Tracing Framework for Interdisciplinary Adaptation

The cross-domain generalization of existing Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is challenged by the heterogeneity in studentsâ€™ cognitive abilities and divergent domain-specific knowledge structures. To mitigate this limitation, we propose TransKT, a transferable KT framework designed for interdisciplinary adaptation. TransKT enhances existing KT models by dynamically aligning student representations and integrating external knowledge semantics. Specifically, the framework incorporates an Interdisciplinary Graph Matching (IGM) module, which constructs subject-aware graphs from student learning trajectories and employs graph attention networks coupled with contrastive learning to capture meta-skill representations. Through cross-domain node matching, IGM aligns student-specific features to improve tracing accuracy. Additionally, an Interdisciplinary Attention-Assisted (IAA) module leverages pretrained language models to extract semantic meta-knowledge from textual content, which is fused with the original input via a multimodal attention mechanism to strengthen transferability. Extensive experiments show that TransKT consistently improves seven main stream KT models (e.g., SAKT) under direct transfer settings on the ASSIST2015 and DBE-KT22 datasets, with average gains of 14.2% in ACC and 4.5% in AUC. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in facilitating cross-disciplinary knowledge tracing transfer.
